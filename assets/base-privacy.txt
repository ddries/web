Introduction
================

This privacy policy aims to describe the base layer [1] of how user data is collected and used in any of my software (any software published and/or developed under the public name of <dries>).

Should any specific software collect, use or handle data in a different manner, the aforementioned software will have its own privacy policy published and distributed together with the software. The additional policy will describe in detail the further data requirements and will apply on top of this document.

[1] = `base layer` refers to a policy which is applied to all software, with further specific privacy policies or not.


============================
Accepting this agreement
============================

This document is accepted by the end user [2] by making use of the software.

[2] = the `end user` is whom the software is targeted.


================================================
About data and how it is collected
================================================

Only essential data needed for the proper functioning of software will be collected. The end user will be noticed about data collection during software utilization.

Should no further privacy policies be published for any specific software, no end user data will be collected.

Data collected can be volatile or persistent. Persistent data is stored in persistent software domain (local files, remote database, etc.). Volatile data is stored in volatile software domain (program memory, ram). For security reasons, both volatile and persistent data collection will be announced to the end user during software utilization.

For persistent data collection, further privacy policies will describe how the deletion of data can be requested by the end user and how it is stored.
